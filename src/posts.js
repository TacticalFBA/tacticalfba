    body:
      "<p>For your first time working with a supplier, you want your order quantity to be as small as possible. The smaller the quantity, the smaller the risk you expose yourself to.</p><p>Even within the same product type, you will see the MOQ vary widely. And in my experience, this MOQ is a starting point and definitely negotiable.</p><p>Try to negotiate down to what you are comfortable with, and don't be afraid to move on to another supplier if they are not budging. </p><p>But at the same time, keep in mind that too low of a quantity will lose the interest of suppliers as well. </p><p>It depends on the product, but for us, we aim usually for an initial order quantity of around 200-500 units. We show the supplier the other products we sell, our website, and our expected order size and frequency in the future (assuming all goes well). </p><p>For highly customized products such as a CNC'ed aluminum product, we dropped the order quantity down to 20 units. Again, the idea is to assume the worst (poor quality, poor tolerances, etc) and after the supplier proving themselves, then increasing to 1000-2000 unit orders. </p>",
