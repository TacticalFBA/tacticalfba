    question: "What is the general process?",
    answer:
      "For most of our services such as product inserts, after you finalize your design and choose your quantity, we print the inserts in our printing press in Shanghai and ship directly to your partnering factory in China for packaging (most if not all suppliers provide this as a complimentary service).",
  },

    question:
      "What are the advantages of using TacticalFBA for product inserts?",
    answer:
      "By creating your product inserts in China, you save money on printing and shipping costs. Since suppliers will package the inserts for you for free, you save on labor costs as well.<br>In addition to the cost savings, our printing press located in Shanghai is state-of-the-art, offering precision, speed, and versatility.",

    question:
      "What if I want my order shipped to the United States (or elsewhere)?",
    answer:
      "At this time, you are only able to ship your order anywhere within China. We plan to offer international shipping soon!",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer:
      "We sell our product inserts at $50 per 1000 inserts with shipping to your partnering factory/supplier included. Coming out at $0.05 each, product inserts are an extremely cost-effective way to upsell, incentivize repeat purchases, and encourage feedback.<br>If your order at your supplier is under 1000 units, they would be more than happy to hold the surplus for you. An order of 1000 product inserts is about the size of a brick.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take my order to ship?",
    answer:
      "After placing your order, it will be on its way to your factory within 7 days. We will send you and your factory contact a tracking number when it is in transit.",
